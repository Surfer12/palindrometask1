680. Valid Palindrome II
Easy

Given a string s, return true if the s can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.

Example 1:
Input: s = "aba"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "abca"
Output: true
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.

Example 3:
Input: s = "abc"
Output: false

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
- s consists of lowercase English letters.

Objective: This assignment evaluates your ability to solve algorithmic problems efficiently and analyze their complexity. You will demonstrate your skills by solving two problems related to palindromes on LeetCode.

Problems:

Valid Palindrome:
LeetCode Problem LinkLinks to an external site.
Valid Palindrome II:
LeetCode Problem LinkLinks to an external site.
Requirements:

Solve the two Leetcode problems .
Optimization: Aim for a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) for both solutions.
Documentation:
Analyze the time and space complexity of each solution with clear explanations.
Compile all code, screenshots, and analysis into a single Word document and save it as a PDF named "CIS233_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.pdf".
Provide screenshots of your code for both problems within the LeetCode environment.
Rubric:

Code Accuracy (60%):

Excellent: Both solutions are accepted by LeetCode with no errors.
Good: One solution is accepted with no errors, or both are accepted with minor errors.
Fair: One solution is accepted with significant errors, or both have minor errors.
Needs Improvement: Neither solution is accepted, or both have significant errors.
Time Complexity Analysis (20%):

Excellent: Accurate and detailed analysis of the time complexity for both solutions, demonstrating a clear understanding of Big O notation.
Good: Accurate analysis of time complexity for at least one solution, with minor inaccuracies or incomplete explanations for the other.
Fair: Partially accurate analysis of time complexity for both solutions, with significant inaccuracies or incomplete explanations.
Needs Improvement: Inaccurate or missing analysis of time complexity.
Code Optimization (20%):

Excellent: Both solutions achieve O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. Code is clean, concise, and well-commented.
Good: One solution achieves the optimal time and space complexity. The other solution may have slightly higher complexity or less efficient code.
Fair: Neither solution fully achieves the optimal complexity, but there is an attempt at optimization. Code may be difficult to read or poorly commented.
Needs Improvement: No attempt at optimization. Code is inefficient and/or poorly documented.
